# The Entangled Explorer
This project was developed for the Quantum Games Hackathon 2023 organised by the Quantum AI Foundation.

# Backstory
In the not-so-distant future, a brilliant young physicist named Max finds himself at the epicenter of a failed experiment that forever alters the course of his life. In his research laboratory, Max and his team of physicists were on the brink of unlocking new potentials in quantum computing. Unfortunately, their ambitious experiment took an unexpected turn.
During the experiment, a catastrophic mishap occurred, leaving Max’s quantum state entangled with the very particles he was studying. As a result, his body is constantly on the brink of instability. When his concentration wavers, his temperature rises rapidly, threatening to throw his quantum state into chaos.
Max embarks on a perilous journey through a surreal, quantum-inspired world. He must navigate treacherous platforms, solve intricate quantum circuits, and harness his newfound abilities to control his temperature. All the while, he's driven by the hope of one day reversing the experiment's effects and returning to his normal state.
With each level presenting a new quantum challenge, can the Entangled Explorer regain control of his quantum state, and uncover the secrets of the experiment that changed his life forever? 

# How to play
Use the arrow keys ↑, ↓, ← & → to move the character across platforms to collect logic gates. The goal is to collect all gates to complete the circuit, while keeping the character’s temperature under control.
